In the 6-18 GHz frequency band, the mixer demonstrates 25 dB for the isolations, an input RF compression point higher than 16 dBm and an Input IP3 of 25 dBm.

	abstract={This paper critically compares the various monolithic low noise amplifier (LNA) circuit topologies using BiCMOS or MESFET technologies for RF and microwave applications, in addition to the conventional techniques, five newly proposed schemes for the simultaneous noise and input power matching are extensively compared with each other at microwave frequencies. At L-band, the best scheme is found to be the proposed cascode inductive series feedback (CCSF) or common-source inductive series feedback (CSSL)+common-gate inductive parallel feedback (CGPF) when 0.5 mu;m GaAs MESFET is used, while it is cascode resistive parallel feedback (CCPF) when n-p-n BJT is used. At C- and X-bands, the proposed CGPF exhibits the best performance. Other than CGPF, the CSSL+CGPF seems to he the best at 6 GHz, and both CCPF+CGPF and CSSL+CGPF are recommended at 12 GHz. Finally, to verify the feasibility of this approach, a CCPF has been fabricated with 0.5 mu;m GaAs MMIC technology, of which measured results agree well with the simulated ones },

    abstract = {The theoretical and experimental results for white noise in the low-power subthreshold region of operation of an MOS transistor are discussed. It is shown that the measurements are consistent with the theoretical predictions. Measurements of noise in photoreceptors-circuits containing a photodiode and an MOS transistor-that are consistent with theory are reported. The photoreceptor noise measurements illustrate the intimate connection of the equipartition theorem of statistical mechanics with noise calculations},

emphasizing recent technological developments and design paradigms that
students and practicing engineers need to master to succeed in today's
industry. Based on the author's teaching and research experience in the past
ten years, the text follows three general principles: (1) Motivate the reader
by describing the significance and application of each idea with real-world
problems; (2) Force the reader to look at concepts from an intuitive point of
view. preparing him/her for more complex problems; (3) Complement the
intuition by rigorous analysis, confirming the results obtained by the
intuitive, yet rough approach.},

@article{johnson25,
    abstract = {(1) In the absence of space charge. This effect, discovered by Schottky, which depends on the probability fluctuations of electron emission from a filament, has been measured over a considerable range of conditions in resonant circuits of which the natural frequency was varied from 8 to nearly 6000 p.p.s. The effect is much larger in the lower range of frequencies than the theory predicts. With a tungsten filament, the ratio of observed to theoretical effect eâ²/e is about.7 for frequencies above 200, but increases rapidly to 50 at 10 cycles per sec. With an oxide coated filament, the ratio increases from 1 at 5000 cycles to 100 at 100 cycles. This is interpreted to mean that the emission of electrons is not strictly chaotic but is influenced by irregular temporal changes in the cathode emissivity. In a high frequency circuit these changes become imperceptible and the emission is effectively random. (2) When current is limited by space charge the Schottky effect decreases because of the interaction of the electrons, and other disturbances may act upon the space charge so as to completely mask the remanent Schottky effect. The magnitude of the disturbances in amplifying vacuum tubes can therefore not be predicted from measurements on the true Schottky effect.},
