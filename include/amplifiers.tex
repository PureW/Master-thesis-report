\chapter{Amplifier Design}\label{ch:amp}

	After down-conversion, the signal must be amplified twice according to the chip design in \autoref{chap:sysdes}. Furthermore, the LO-signal controlling the mixer also needs amplification. The function and purpose of these three amplifiers are explained in this chapter.

	\section{Introduction}
		\subsection{Function}
			The purpose of an amplifier is to amplify electric signals. In a radar receiver setup the amplifier is often, after a limiter and a filter, the first element an incoming signal sees. Any degradation of the signal's power before the first amplification increases the noise (see \autoref{fig:noise_example}). The main goal of such an amplifier is to provide gain without adding noise and is called an LNA (low noise amplifier).

			The last amplifier in a transmitter-setup is more focused on providing as much gain and output power as possible without consuming too much power. For most amplifiers it is also of concern to operate linearly. This is measured with $IIP3$ and $P_{1dB}$ as explained in \autoref{sec:ip3}.

			An amplifier designed with FET-technology needs a drain-supply voltage $v_{ds}$ (drain-source), see \autoref{fig:fet-illustrative}. The current through the FET, $i_{ds}$ (drain-source current), depends on the gate-source voltage $v_{gs}$ which, in effect, is the incoming signal fed to the gate-terminal. It is the time-varying $i_{ds}$ that creates the amplification.

		\end{figure}

		\subsection{Bias point}
			When operating the FET, there are in general four different bias points corresponding to different classes of amplifiers.\autocite{gonzalez84} These are seen in \autoref{fig:fet_bias_point}. For low noise operation, bias point A is common and for high output-power and class A operation, bias point C is more prevalent.

				\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/amplifiers/fet_bias_point}
				\caption{Different bias points for a FET.}\label{fig:fet_bias_point}
			\end{figure}

		\subsection{Bias scheme}\label{sec:bias}
			The amplifiers in this project are biased using the self-biasing scheme in \autoref{fig:if1bias}.\autocite{bahl03} This limits the size and complexity of the bias network as only one (positive) DC source is supplied. The PPH25 process can, contrary to PH25,  handle a higher drain-source voltage $v_{ds}$ over the FET. This further simplifies the biasing as the supplied \unit[5]{V} DC voltage can be applied without the need of a resistor on the drain, given that this constitutes an appropriate bias point.

			\end{figure}

		\subsection{Stability}
			A stable amplifier ensures that there is no oscillation.\autocite{grosch99} The amplifiers on this chip are all designed to be unconditionally stable at all frequencies. Generally, an amplifier with higher gain is harder to make stable. The stability measure $K$ in \autoref{eq:kstability} is used to quantify stability. An amplifier is unconditionally stable if $K>1$ for all frequencies.

			\begin{equation}\label{eq:kstability}
				K=\frac{1+|S_{11}S_{22}-S_{12}S_{21}|^2-|S_{11}|^2-|S_{22}|^2}{2|S_{12}||S_{21}|}
			\end{equation}

		\subsection{Power utilization}\label{sec:power}
			As the DC-power consumption of an amplifier increases, the linearity ($P_{1dB}$ and $IIP_3$) increases. This is evident as compression will occur at higher power (\autoref{sec:p1db}). The LO amplifier is designed to operate in compression and as such it does not benefit from high power. The remaining available DC-power is divided between the first and the second IF amplifier. As the $IIP_3$ for the second amplifier affects the chip more than that of the first one, the power utility here is higher.

	\section{Constant power LO-amplifier}\label{sec:lo_amp}
		\subsection{Introduction}
			The input LO-signal is specified to \unit[-5--0]{dBm} and there is therefore a need to amplify this signal. The purpose of the amplifier is to provide a high and constant input power to the mixer, not sensitive to fluctuations of the input LO-signal. This is achieved by operating the amplifier in compression so that the mixer always sees the same LO. Also, by running the amplifier in compression, i.e. outputting a square-waved pulse, the mixer will switch faster between the on- and off-states, behaving more like an ideal switch. This results in a more linear mixer as explained in \autoref{sec:mixer_lodrive}.\autocite{vice03} %The LO-amplifier is matched against the mixer which is a highly reactive load.



		\subsection{Design}
			\subsubsection{Principle}
				When designing an LO-amplifier for a resistive FET mixer, it is important to minimize reflections from the very reactive mixer-gate. However, attaining a well-matched gate is difficult.\autocite{yhland1999} At first, a bias-point is chosen, such that proper gain and compression is achieved. As a \unit[0.5]{GHz} bandwidth is important, a weak feedback loop ($\unit[500]{\Omega}$) is used. A too strong feedback is undesirable because of the reduced gain and stability. The FET is self-biased by applying a voltage to the drain, while having $v_{DC}=\unit[0]{V}$ on the gate (see \ref{sec:bias} \nameref{sec:bias}). This requires having an inductance to ground close to the gate. Schematic and layout of the amplifier are seen in \autoref{fig:sch_lo} and \autoref{fig:lo_layout}, respectively.



				As noise is not of much concern for the LO, it can be traded for stability, compression, ease of tuning and frequency independence. Since linearity is actually to be avoided and the amplifier never enters high-linearity bias-regions such as for class A-operation, the amplifier consumes small amounts of power, around \unit[100]{mW}.

				\caption[LO-amplifier layout]{The layout of the LO-amplifier with a weak parallel feedback, slightly elongated source for input matching, and a self-biasing scheme.\scalemum}\label{fig:lo_layout}
			\end{figure}



		\subsubsection{FET-configuration and matching networks}\label{sec:lo_fet_config}
			Large FETs are used for linear operation, which is to be avoided for the compression technique to work.\autocite{maas98} In \autoref{fig:FET_size_S22}, the drain impedance for different FET-sizes is simulated. It shows that a smaller FET such as \unit[4$\times$25]{\mum} is a better conjugate match for the mixer since only reactive matching networks would be needed. However, such a small FET does not provide enough gain. Therefore a FET-size of \unit[4$\times$50]{\mum} is chosen.

	The input matching network consists of an L-shaped inductor-inductor network and a shunt-resistance. The length of the source is chosen such that input reflections are small. The output matching network needs to match the reactive gate of the mixing FET. This is done with a shunt capacitance and an inductance in series. The inductance to ground keeps the gate of the mixing FET at $v_{DC}=\unit[0]{V}$.

However, \unit[4$\times$25]{\mum} does not provide enough gain.} \label{fig:FET_size_S22}
			\end{figure}

		\subsubsection{Bias point}
			The amplifier enters compression when applying a low $v_{ds}$ as seen in \autoref{fig:4x50_output_power} where output power is shown versus input LO power for different FET-bias points. The bias point $v_{gs}=\unit[-0.4]{V}$, $v_{ds}=\unit[2]{V}$ provides a signal in compression.

			\end{figure}



		\subsection{Simulation results}

			The simulation results for the LO-amplifier are presented in \autoref{tab:resultlo} for two ranges of input powers. The power delivered into the mixing FET is shown in \autoref{fig:lo_delivered_power} and it is clear that the amplifier is operating in compression for input powers of \unit[-2--0]{dBm} and less so for weaker input powers. The square-wave pulse is seen in figure \autoref{fig:lo_waveform}.

			The input reflections are shown in \autoref{fig:lo_reflections}. The reflections become a problem at higher frequencies and weaker input powers around \unit[-4]{dBm}. Good input matching is hard to achieve with the current amplifier design. As the load is changing depending on input power, it is difficult to match for all input powers. Emphasis has been placed on achieving a good match for $P_{LO}=\unit[-2]{dBm}$ which is considered to be the most likely input power.



%\autoref{tab:resultlo} presents LO-performance for input powers of $LO=\unit[-4$--$ -2]{dBm}$ and $LO=\unit[-2$--$0]{dBm}$. Delivered power and reflections are seen in \autoref{fig:lo_delivered_power} and \autoref{fig:lo_reflections}, respectively. The performance is good for higher input powers, for weaker input powers, the reflections become a problem at higher frequencies. Good input matching is hard to achieve with the current amplifier design. As the amplifier is running in compression, the load is changing depending on input power which makes it hard to match for all input powers. Emphasis has been placed on achieving a good match for $P_{lo}=\unit[-2]{dBm}$ which is considered to be the most likely input power. 	The square-wave pulse is seen in figure \autoref{fig:lo_waveform}.

			\end{figure}





			The spread analysis, \autoref{fig:lo_spread}, suggests that the LO-amplifier is sensitive to variations. The delivered power may drop as much as \unit[2]{dB} for input powers of $\unit[-2]{dBm}$. %The frequency dependence of the spread is due to spread in the FET.
			However, when spreading the LO- and mixer-FET, the mixer conversion gain and compression are hardly affected (\autoref{fig:lo_mixer_spread}). This suggests that the power supplied to the mixer is above a threshold-power where it is fair to assume that stronger LO is less important\autocite{yhland1999}. However, for $P_{LO}=\unit[-4]{dBm}$, the mixer $P_{1dB}$ is affected and drops on one occasion to \unit[9.7]{dBm}.



	\subsection{Gain versus compression}
		It is possible to increase the amplifier's gain by increasing $v_{ds}$ a little, but this would not compress the signal as much. As seen in \autoref{fig:lo_mixer_gain_comparison}, the mixer gain for the compressed LO-signal has the same frequency dependence for different LO-powers. If the gain is increased, i.e. not so strong compression, the LO-signal will vary for different input signal and this causes the mixer-gain to behave badly  (Figure\autoref{fig:lo_mixergain_not_compressed}). When the LO-drive to the mixer becomes too large, the mixer-gain suffers.

	\subsection{Discussion}
		The key feature of the LO-amplifier is the square-waved pulse which helps to achieve a more linear mixer. The gain of the amplifier is somewhat low, this is attributed to the compression technique and the matching to the very reactive mixer FET. But having a more powerful LO, and thereby a greater mixer $P_{1dB}$, would not yield a great increase in the complete chip's compression point as the IF-amplifiers are the limiting factor. Also, for a stronger LO-drive, it is more difficult to reach adequate LO-isolation, see \autoref{fig:sysspectrum}.

		The amplifier can deliver some more gain in exchange for compression by increasing $v_{ds}$ a notch, see \autoref{fig:lo_mixer_gain_comparison}. However, there are repercussions on the mixer gain if the LO becomes too large. Therefore it might be of future interest to vary the \unit[5]{V}-bias voltage to achieve the desired bias-point. It is also possible to increase the gate-source voltage, $v_{gs}$, for some gain and increased power consumption.

		The interaction between mixer conversion gain and LO-amplifier is difficult to foresee which is why the matching network was modified many times and some adjustments to the diplexer's band-pass filter were made before acceptable performance was achieved.

		The literature states that a single ended FET resistive mixer has $P_{1dB}$ approximately \unit[4]{dB} above the LO-drive\autocite{radmanesh2002state} and the result of this LO-mixer construction approximately follows that rule. A $P_{1dB}$ of \unit[12]{dBm} at $P_{LO}=\unit[-4]{dBm}$, at center frequency and a \unit[3]{dB} attenuation in the diplexer says that the required LO should be \unit[5]{dBm}. The LO-amplifier outputs \unit[3.5]{dBm} at these conditions, and it is thought that the square-waved LO-drive accounts for the extra linearity.

		The reflections are tuned for an input power of \unit[-2]{dBm} but as the load changes for different input powers, it is difficult to achieve low reflections on all frequencies and for all input powers. Especially input powers of \unit[-4]{dBm} and high frequencies result in input reflections being \unit[-10]{dB}.

		The yield analysis, Figure \autoref{fig:lo_delivered_power_spread_-2dBm}, shows a large spread in delivered power, especially at high frequencies.  The spread at $P_{LO}=\unit[-2]{dBm}$ hardly affects the mixer conversion gain and compression point, suggesting that the delivered power is enough for this mixer. As the amplifier is much less in compression for $P_{LO}=\unit[-4]{dBm}$, the spread starts to affect the mixer performance (\autoref{fig:lo_mixer_spread}).

		%It is generally true that the compression technique and reflections behave much better for LO-signals in the band \unit[-2--0]{dBm}.
		Future work could investigate if it is possible to choose another bias-point with more gain and still maintain good compression and matching to the mixer. The parallel feedback could possibly be removed for some additional gain.  One solution to the large spread in the FET may be to use another bias-scheme which could be adjusted after production on a per-chip basis.
		For other MMIC-designs where the mixer requires a much stronger LO-drive, a two-stage LO-amplifier might be justified. The first stage would then supply high gain while the second stage compresses the signal.

	\section{Low noise IF-amplifier}
		\subsection{Introduction}
			All components of the MMIC should be as linear as possible. However, the noise figure in the system also requires attention. Together with the conversion loss in the mixer, the first IF-amplifier contributes with  most noise. This amplifier is therefore designed as a low noise amplifier (LNA). Linearity is still of high importance, which is why the amplifier should also have high $P_{1dB}$ and high $IIP_3$. As the IF-signal is a narrow band, the amplifier's bandwidth is only \unit[20]{MHz}.

		\subsection{Design}
			\subsubsection{Principle}
				The principle design of an LNA is to find the input matching network that minimizes the noise of the amplifier and at the same time matches to $S_{11}$. The first part of this would be finding the best FET size. In order to match to both $S_{11}$ and optimum noise, a series feedback is implemented.\autocite{lehmann85} The final noise figure of the amplifier is primarily the combination of both the losses in the input matching network and the noise inherent to the FET. The amplifier is biased according to the self-biasing scheme detailed in \autoref{sec:bias}.

			\subsubsection{Noise}\label{sec:if1noise}
				There is no noise model for the PPH25 FET. The only data available are measurements of a \unit[4$\times$75]{\mum} FET provided by UMS. To estimate the amplifier's noise the PH25 model is used. This model together with the similarity in behaviour between the PH25 and the PPH25 FET gives a crude estimate of the noise figure. The position of the $\Gamma_{opt}$ is approximately the same for the different processes. The noise increases faster in the PPH25 case as mismatch increases (see \autoref{fig:if1noisematch}). Approximately \unit[0.5]{dB} is added to the noise simulated with the PH25 FET to get the PPH25 noise, provided the mismatch is not too large.

			\begin{figure}[hbt!]
				\centering
				%\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{fig/amplifiers/if1/noisematch}

				\caption[$\Gamma_{opt}$ and constant noise circles for UMS FETs.]{$\Gamma_{opt}$ and constant noise circles for different UMS FET, both PH25 and PPH25. Both the absolute noise and the noise increase with mismatch are greater for PPH25. The \unit[8$\times$75]{\mum} is the biggest FET available. It has the lowest inherent noise, the most conveniently placed $\Gamma_{opt}$ and is the most linear device (see \autoref{sec:mixerdevice}).}\label{fig:if1noisematch}
			\end{figure}

			\subsubsection{FET selection and input network}
				Based on the noise properties of the FETs and previous work with the PH25 process\autocite{gustavsson07}, the \unit[8$\times$75]{\mum} FET is chosen for the amplifier. Fortunately, both low noise and linear operation favours a large device. The input network is a simple L-shaped inductor-inductor impedance matching network.

			\subsubsection{Attenuator}
				The chip design requires the amplifier to have a certain gain. If the gain of this amplifier is higher, the total $IIP_3$ will suffer and if it is lower the final noise will increase. As the amplifier's gain is higher than the specified \unit[12]{dB}, an attenuator consisting of two resistors is placed at the end. It is designed to optimize the input and output matching as well as add to the stability.\autocite{delpy06} An alternative to an attenuator is parallel feedback. This design would however degrade the noise figure and has therefore been discarded.

%		\subsubsection{Source Pull Analysis}
%			A source pull analysis that plots constant noise figure curves along with the optimal $S_{11}$ input match has been conducted (\autoref{fig:if1sourcepull}). The contours show that low noise and good matching overlap fairly good. This is overlap is mostly due to the series feedback.

		\subsection{Discussion}
			The narrowband property of the amplifier enables a design in which parallel feedback can be omitted. This has a good impact on the noise figure but it also gives a steep gain slope and a gate that is hard to match. One consequence is that the matching inductors become very large which in turn increases the noise figure as the UMS inductors have a somewhat low quality factor Q. Another consequence is that if the frequency characteristics shift only \unit[100]{MHz} during fabrication, the performance of the amplifier will change dramatically. Detailed frequency dependence can be found in \autoref{sec:yieldif1}.

			A noise figure of \unit[1.5]{dB} can by LNA-standards not be considered low. In the PH25 process, this value could very well be cut in half.\autocite{kyuko96} Still, amplifier IF1 is not only designed for low noise, but also to be linear. This leads to a compromise in which the slightly noisier power-PH25 process without noise models is used.

The noise value is not that sensitive to the source impedance. The area for which the value stays below \unit[0.4]{dB} is large. It is therefore likely that the noise originating from the components matching the input of the amplifier will cause more noise than mismatching the input itself will.}\label{fig:if1sourcepull}

	\section{High-power IF-amplifier}
		\subsection{Introduction}\label{sec:if2power}
			The last amplification stage has, together with the mixing component, the biggest impact on the overall chip linearity. As discussed earlier, the more DC-power provided, the more linear the operation becomes. Because the signal has already been amplified once, the overall noise figure is not very sensitive to the noise here. High power devices generate a lot of heat and this has to be taken into consideration.

		\subsection{Design}
			\subsubsection{Principle}
				To design a high linearity amplifier a method similar but opposite to the one used to design an LNA is used. Instead of matching the input to the noise optimum, the output is matched to peak $P_{1dB}$. The first step is to create a stable and input-matched circuit. Feedback circuits are used to control the gain and the linearity of the amplifier. Using this amplifier load-pull simulations are made for different bias points. This way it is possible to see which bias point and output matching network give the most linear operation.\autocite{anand08}

			\subsubsection{Thermal considerations}
				Calculations performed on the FETs' junction temperatures show that in order to handle the available DC-power and the specified ambient temperature, there has to be two FETs. With only one \unit[8$\times$75]{\mum} FET, the junction temperature $T_j$ exceeds \unit[170]{$^\circ C$}, which is the maximum rating for a GaAs FET. $T_j$ is calculated using thermal resistance models\autocite{fukui80}, where $T_0$ is set to $\unit[100]{^\circ C}$:

				\begin{equation}
					T_j=T_0+P_{FET}R_{TH}
				\end{equation}

				$P_{FET}$ is the power dissipated over the FET and $R_{TH}$ is the FETs thermal resistance according to the models. $T_0$, the temperature on the backside of the chip, is the sum of the ambient temperature and the estimated thermal resistance in the circuit board and the chip package. If the total thermal resistance is $\unit[15]{^\circ C}$, the chip can handle an ambient temperature of $\unit[100]{^\circ C}-\unit[15]{^\circ C}=\unit[85]{^\circ C}$.

				With two \unit[6$\times$75]{\mum} FETs, the maximum $T_j$ becomes $\approx$ \unit[150]{$^\circ C$}, which is a high although manageable temperature. Two FETs placed in parallel can be viewed as one big FET with the number of gate fingers equal to the sum of the parts, thus resulting in an equivalent \unit[12$\times$75]{\mum} FET.

			\subsubsection{Feedback and bias}
				The second IF-amplifier is biased in the same manner as the first one, described in \autoref{sec:bias}. This amplifier has both series feedback and parallel negative feedback. Though very small, the inductor on the source creating the series feedback is needed for stability and gain control. The parallel feedback that connects the drain to the gate has an attenuating resistance and a capacitance for DC blocking. The purpose of this feedback is to simplify matching and to provide high bandwidth. Although the signal is of a narrowband frequency, it is preferable if not both amplifiers' gain are frequency sensitive. The parallel feedback also makes the amplifier less stable.

				The FETs decrease in gain slightly as the temperature rises. To compensate for this loss, a resistor of GaAs type is chosen for the parallel feedback. This resistor has a positive temperature gradient. This way the decrease in gain is reduced by the smaller feedback.

			\subsubsection{Linearity analysis}
				The \unit[1]{dB}-compression point, $P_{1dB}$, is simulated for different $i_{ds}$ (\autoref{fig:if2p1dbvspower}). A load pull analysis with both the output matching and $P_{1dB}$ analysed is shown in \autoref{fig:if2lp}. The analysis shows the importance of choosing a correct, and in this case high power, bias point to optimize the two quantities. From the three plots combined it can be seen that the linearity increases dramatically with increased power until peak $P_{1dB}$ is aligned with optimum output match. After that, the increase is only linear. This overall linearity increase agrees with the discussion about power utilisation in \autoref{sec:power}.

		\subsection{Discussion}
			The thermal limitations force a two-FET amplifier design. This requires more space but effectively splits the source-drain current for each device in half. Another interesting observation is that the amplifier's linearity increased in the process. $P_{1dB}$ increased with \unit[4]{dB}, keeping the power consumption unchanged. The reason for this increase is attributed the same general reason why large devices are preferred over small when designing high-linearity class A amplifiers.

			Even though the junction temperature in the FETs has been reduced dramatically with the dual-FET design, the asymmetric design with only one source network causes a large current to flow through the upper transistor (\autoref{fig:if2layout}). The FET connected to the source has the DC-current of the other transistor in the source. In these UMS FETs, the source layers are connected with \unit[14]{\mum} air bridges. According to the maximum ratings these layers can only handle \unit[7.5]{mA/\mum}. This gives a total of $\unit[105]{mA}$ and the design is just above that ($\unit[110]{mA}$). The three alternatives are either to reduce the current $\unit[5]{mA}$, to widen the air bridge \unit[1]{\mum} or to route a common source for both FETs from the middle strip via an air bridge.

			The implemented negative parallel feedback provides wider bandwidth and easier matching. The bandwidth may seem unnecessary considering the narrow band. However, as amplifier IF1 is designed with a steep gain slope, it is preferable that this amplifier is not. This is due to the possibility of process variation in the frequency dependence. A variation within this design limits most damage in performance to amplifier IF1.

			The noise figure in the amplifier is approximately \unit[0.5]{dB} higher than in amplifier IF1. This shows that even though the input network is simpler, the parallel feedback results in an increase in noise. Also, no effort has been made to match noise optimum with the input match in this amplifier.
